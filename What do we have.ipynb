    "- popularity-based engines: usually the most simple to implement be also the most impersonal\n",
    "- content-based engines: the recommendations are based on the description of the products\n",
    "- collaborative filtering engines: records from various users provide recommendations based on user similarities\n",
    "- In the current case, since the dataset only describe the content of the films and TV series, collaborative filtering is excluded and I will thus build an engine that uses both the content and the popularity of the entries.\n",

    "- Similarity\n",
    "    - ranking -> director + actors + keywords + genre\n",
    "        - All features are booleans, yes/no each film has that directory/actor/keyword/genre (perhaps the main one is all trues)\n",
